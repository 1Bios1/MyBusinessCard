                    My full-name is Amir Rakhimov Anvarovich. 
                    I recently graduated from 9th grade school and have already applied for college, I hope for free education. 
                    My first language was python, I studied it for about three or four months, I have already reached the framework and joined the NON-commercial development of the site. 
                    But once I scroll the Internet and looked a little bit about the web, I concluded for myself that python is good for the web, but not the best option. 
                    it would be better to choose php or frontend development on Js. 
                    Well, it was sad, yes, and I set priorities in a different way, and then my choice fell on frontend site development, this direction at first glance is easier 
                    than back-end development and it will be easier for me to 
                    integrate into IT through a frontend developer. 
                </div>
                <div class="text text-2">
                    So I started studying HTML5 and CSS, then preprocessors went, 
                    then flex-box, grid, then the BEM methodology, 
                    and after some time I'm sitting here in front of a computer and writing a business card site to throw my resume to some company to try to enter this, let's say, 
                    a difficult area called IT from the side of the front-end coder yes, 
                    my work experience is not as high as you employers would like, 
                    but I can say with confidence that if you give me a job, 
                    I will give my best 100 no 200% percent
